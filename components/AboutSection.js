      <h2>About</h2>

In college, she learned to manage camera equipment within the film department. In recent times, she has served as a mock up artist for a company that designs paper goods, like gift bags and stationary. She is inherently detail-oriented, finding immense satisfaction in projects that demand precision and an accumulation of effort over time.</p>
